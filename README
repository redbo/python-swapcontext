This probably isn't what you want.

I just wrote it to benchmark greenlet against the system's swapcontext.

BTW, greenlet is fast.

redbo@saio:~/swapcontext$ python perf.py
   greenlet 0.0600001811981
swapcontext 0.369999885559

redbo@saio:~/swapcontext$ python perf2.py
   greenlet 0.0599999427795
swapcontext 0.150000095367
